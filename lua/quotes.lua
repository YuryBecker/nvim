    One reason it was profitable to carve up 1980s companies

    There was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing
    all mechanical things. After serving his company loyally for over 30 years,
    he happily retired. Several years later his company contacted him regarding
    a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of
    their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and everyone
    else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail. In desperation, they called
    on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past.
    The engineer reluctantly took the challenge.
    He spent a day studying the huge machine.
    At the end of the day he marked a small X in chalk on a particular component
    of the machine and proudly stated, 'This is where your problem is!'
    The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again.
    The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his services.
    They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges.
    The engineer responded briefly:
    One chalk mark - 1, Knowing where to put it - 49,999
